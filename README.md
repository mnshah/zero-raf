# Zero RAF RS

The Zero-RAF RS project is a rust implementation of Medicare's Risk Adjustment 
Factor calculations using zero knowledge proofs. The goal of this
project is to be able to compute risk scores for 1 or more
people in a covered population and to generate a proof that the 
computations were done correctly.

This is a Rust implementation of Zero-RAF to be used with the RISC Zero proving system.

# Data

## V28

The CMS-HCC coefficients are not available in a format other than SAS CPORT. The csv was generated by converting the CPORT file to CSV using the StatTransfer program. TO get StatTransfer to recognize the file, you need to add the ".stc" file extension to indicate it is a SAS CPORT file.

TODO: Add a more trustworthy method of gathering the coefficients used by CMS to be used by the Host code.
