# Zero RAF RS

The Zero-RAF project is an implementation of Medicare's Risk Adjustment 
Factor calculations using zero knowledge circuits. The goal of this
project is to be able to calculated risk scores for 1 or more
people in a covered population and to generate a proof that the 
calculations were done correctly.

This is a Rust implementation of Zero-RAF to be used with the RISC Zero proving system.


# RISC Zero Rust Starter Template

Welcome to the RISC Zero Rust Starter Template! This template is intended to give you a starting point for building a project using the RISC Zero zkVM. Throughout the code are comments labelled `TODO` in places where we expect projects will need to modify the code.


# Data Provenance

## V28

The CMS-HCC coefficients are not available in a format other than SAS CPORT. The csv was generated by converting the CPORT file to CSV using the StatTransfer program. TO get StatTransfer to recognize the file, you need to add the ".stc" file extension to indicate it is a SAS CPORT file.



TODO: Add a more trustworthy method of gathering the coefficients used by CMS to be used by the Host code.

## Stable Versions
By default, this template depends on the latest version of RISC Zero: the `main` branch of our [main repository](http://www.github.com/risc0). This gives you access to our latest features and improvements. If you would prefer to use our more stable published crates, we have tags matching those crates that you can use, e.g. `v0.11.1`.

## Contributor's Guide
We welcome contributions to documentation and code via PRs and GitHub Issues on our [main repository](http://www.github.com/risc0), this repository, or any of our other repositories.
