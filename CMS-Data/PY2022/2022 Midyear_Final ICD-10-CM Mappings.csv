"If an ICD-10 code includes clinical concepts comparable to two or more ICD-9 codes, it may map to more than one payment HCC or RxHCC. If that occurs, the ICD-10 code will repeat in separate rows for each of the multiple HCCs or RxHCCs, with dashes in the repeating rows for the models in which the ICD-10 code maps only to a single HCC or RxHCC.",,,,,,,,,
